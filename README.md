# Job Application RAG
For our semester project for GenAI (CSC 590), we wanted to create a Job Application/Resume RAG. The application was created to allow users to see relevant jobs when provided with their resume.

## Overview
Goal: Create a Generative AI RAG that takes a resume and outputs relevant job listings for the user. 

By analyzing the provided user resume, it can search through the jobs dataset provided and pick the most relevant listings for the user. 

## Key Features
- **User Resume Input**: Users can input their resume with the file upload, which the application will look through and read
- **Model Choosing**: Users can choose which Ollama model they want for the application
- **Job Posting Output**: The application outputs relevant job listings for the user to view, based on their uploaded resume
